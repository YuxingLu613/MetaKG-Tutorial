# KG Construction

The KG Construction guide details the process of building and customizing knowledge graphs using the MetaKG Python package. It elaborates on sourcing data, structuring the knowledge graph, and integrating diverse datasets into a coherent, metabolite-centric model.

#### Data Sources

MetaKG integrates data from a wide array of reputable sources, including HMDB, KEGG, SMPDB, ChEBI, PubChem, and UniProt. The guide explains how to access and utilize these datasets for knowledge graph construction.

#### Constructing the Knowledge Graph

To construct a knowledge graph with MetaKG, users follow a systematic approach:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the MetaKG environment.
2. **Data Integration**: Import data from selected sources.
3. **Graph Building**: Utilize MetaKGâ€™s tools to structure the data into a graph format, linking entities based on biological relationships and interactions.

#### Customization

The guide also covers how to customize the knowledge graph to cater to specific research needs, such as focusing on particular diseases, pathways, or metabolite interactions.

#### Summary

KG Construction offers a comprehensive overview of creating and customizing metabolite-centric knowledge graphs using MetaKG. It serves as a vital resource for researchers looking to harness the power of knowledge graphs in metabolomics and related fields.
