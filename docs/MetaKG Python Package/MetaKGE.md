# MetaKGE

The MetaKGE guide introduces users to MetaKGE, a component of the MetaKG Python package designed for knowledge graph embedding. Knowledge graph embeddings are a powerful tool for representing entities and relationships within a graph in a continuous vector space, facilitating machine learning tasks such as link prediction, entity classification, and clustering.

### Understanding Knowledge Graph Embeddings

This section explains the concept of knowledge graph embeddings, their significance, and how they can be used to capture the complex relationships and patterns within the MetaKG knowledge graph.

### Generating Embeddings with MetaKGE

Learn how to use MetaKGE to generate embeddings for the entities and relations in MetaKG. The guide covers various embedding techniques and models, such as TransE, DistMult, and RotatE, providing examples and best practices for their application.

### Practical Applications

Explore the practical applications of knowledge graph embeddings generated by MetaKGE, including how they can be used for tasks like hypothesis generation, link prediction between entities (e.g., metabolites and diseases), and uncovering hidden relationships within the graph.

### Summary

The MetaKGE guide is essential for users interested in leveraging the power of knowledge graph embeddings to enhance their research and analytical capabilities. It offers a detailed overview of how to generate and apply embeddings, providing a pathway to unlock new insights and opportunities within the realm of metabolomics and beyond.
